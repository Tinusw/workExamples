- Just a cool example of how you can use the toggle state of a checkbox to trigger css position changes! No jquery needed.

- Using a jquery variable to store various fictional pieces of work, then using bootstrap to format it all nicely. And a small on mouse-enter effect for extra laughs.

- Saves you having to manually add html elements for each new item on a site. Instead you can simply save them in an array, and jquery will populate it for you!


Example 3 - Data Validation (Email form example)

- So really just a few more muscle flexing jquery ideas:

- A running charachter count for the email message body, just ensuring there is content, and also turning red to notify user once he's gone over an acceptable threshold

- Input validation to show a user what needs to be completed for an email to be successfully sent.

- I'm also using a really funky little email validation method that kinda befuddles me. But as far as I can determine it's a version of the addr-spec, which is an internet specific email identifier, and all email addresses need to adhere to it.

- I think there are more hardcore versions of the regular expression out there, but for my purposes that did the job. More here :

- Confirmation message is then shown to a user and input fields are hidden once the message/name/email subscribes to our needs.
